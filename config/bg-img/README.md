# Wallpaper Images

- Check a file's metadata for the artist's credits. Use tools like `exiftool` on Linux or `Right Click -> Properties -> Details` on Windows to view artist.
- Wallpaper names retain its wallhaven identifying key. The key can be used to find the original image. For example, `wallhaven-4gjj9d_1920x1080.png` has key `4gjj9d`. Find the image using this url: `https://whvn.cc/<key goes here>/` e.g. [https://whvn.cc/4gjj9d](https://whvn.cc/4gjj9d).
