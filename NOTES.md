# My Linux Configuration

## Introduction

Configuring a setup is a long, difficult, and repetitive process. It is a waste
of time to reconfigure a system from scratch every time I get a new computer. 
Upon learning about NixOS, I learned that it has the capability of making a highly
reproducible system. It takes alot of effort to learn and configure, but I 
enjoy learnign and configuring my system. So, why not make my configurations
reproduceable and long-lasting?

## Objectives

Create a reproducible configuration that will support my programming work.
- Better secrets management
- Better development tools
- Better development environment closer to a server environment

## Development Log
My initial attempt to build a wayland-based system was unsuccessful.
Understanding why the system was failing after the login screen was too
difficult for me.
